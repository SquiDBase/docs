# Retrieving data from SquiDBase

On the [Browse Datasets](https://squidbase.org/submissions) page, you can explore all available datasets in SquiDBase. A useful feature is the 'Flow Cell Version' filter, which allows you to filter datasets based on the Nanopore chemistry used. For instance, if you're specifically interested in R10.4.1 data, simply select it from the filter, and only datasets that use this chemistry will be displayed.
