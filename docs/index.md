# Welcome

SquiDBase ([squidbase.org](https://squidbase.org/)) is a dedicated database for storing and sharing raw nanopore sequencing data from microbial and viral research projects. By providing a centralized platform, SquiDBase improves data accessibility and encourages its reuse, fostering experimental research and the development of innovative analytical methods.

This guide will help you navigate how to use SquiDBase for retrieving and uploading data. We encourage contributions and are more than happy to assist with data uploadsâ€”feel free to reach out to us at ([squidbase@uantwerpen.be](mailto:squidbase@uantwerpen.be))
